⚙️ Tech Stack & Features:
🛠️ React (v19.1.0) – Fast,component-driven UI
 📡 Groq SDK (v0.19.0) – Integrates AI to generate grammar challenges using the LLaMA3 model
 🧠 AI-Powered Feedback – Detects grammar errors and suggests correct answers
 🔁 Retry Mechanism – Includes exponential backoff & timeout handling for API failures
 📦 Modular Structure:
-components/ – React UI components
-services/ – API layer with error handling and fallback logic
-utils/ – Helper functions like array shuffling
-styles/ – Organized CSS for clean visuals
 🧪 Testing Setup – Jest + React Testing Library for UI validation
 🌐 Environment Ready – Uses .env for keys and clean config separation

🚀 Key Highlights:
•Built in one sitting — from concept to deployment
•AI-integrated grammar activities with JSON-based communication
•Responsive error handling with fallback challenges
•Future-ready architecture: clean separation of logic, styling, and services
•Deployed with dev scripts like npm start, build, and test

This project really tested my speed and focus — learned a ton about API integration, error handling, and structuring a React app efficiently. 😄

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
